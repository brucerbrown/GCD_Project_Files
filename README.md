Project for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course

This project creates one R script, run_analysis.R, which performs the following tasks:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Once executed, the resulting dataset maybe found at MeanCombinedData.txt

To accomplish these steps, run_analysis.R must do the following:



Required R Packages

The R packages reshape2 is required to run this script.
